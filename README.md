A finance website:
A finance website that tracks all the user's accounts that they add to their portfolio. The user adds their finance
information through csv files, and the application will parse the files and then add the information to a MySQL database
for the user. The user can view their entire value of all their accounts and a graph of all their transactions overall
or for a specific account they click on.

Quick facts:
• Implemented front-end and backend code for a finance website
• Integrated PHP with MySQL, CSV parser, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript
• Daily Scrum meetings following agile methodologies
